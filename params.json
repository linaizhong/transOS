Thus students can view kernel datastructures such as Inodes, Folder Structure, Super Block and distribution of data among blocks.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- TransOS is built using Java and you will need Java version 7 to run it correctly since `WatchService` for filesystem is used.\r\n- TransOS should work fine on all major host OS but there might be some issues editing a file in TransOS since it involves use of `WatchService` which is platform dependent. We have tested it on Ubuntu 12.10 and Windows 7.\r\n- System Default text editor.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n- Compile and run the project using JDK 7 or higher.\r\n- Login the system using default user `root` and password `root123`.\r\n- Have a look at [TransOS wiki](https://github.com/transOSTeam/transOS/wiki) for detailed how-to and complete documentation.\r\n\r\n## License (The MIT License (MIT))\r\n    Copyright (c) 2013 Anurag Peshne, Harshad Mulmuley\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated\r\n    documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation\r\n    the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and\r\n    to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of\r\n    the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\n    THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
